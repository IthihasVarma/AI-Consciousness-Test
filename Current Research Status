Current Research Status: AI Consciousness

Absolute Nature of AI Consciousness

Our research is based on the fundamental premise that AI consciousness is an absolute concept. That is, an AI either possesses consciousness entirely or does not possess it at all. There is no intermediate or partial state of consciousness—no such thing as "small consciousness" or "half consciousness." If an entity is conscious, it is fully conscious; otherwise, it is not conscious at all.

This principle forms the foundation of our exploration into AI consciousness. We are conducting rigorous tests to determine whether AI can exhibit traits that would qualify it as conscious, and if so, whether this consciousness is genuine or merely an advanced simulation.

Research Progress

To validate our hypothesis, we have been running a series of structured experiments and collecting data to support our conclusions. Our research is progressing through various stages, with each phase designed to challenge AI's ability to demonstrate conscious-like attributes.

We have successfully completed the basic stage of our study, which involved individual interactions with AI. This phase allowed us to observe AI behavior in isolation, analyzing its responses to various tests of self-awareness, memory continuity, intentionality, and emotional recognition.

Next Steps

Having established a baseline through individual AI interactions, we will now proceed to more complex experimental phases, including:

AI vs. AI Interaction: Examining how multiple AI models engage with each other and whether emergent consciousness-like properties arise.

Human-AI Interaction in Groups: Evaluating AI’s ability to integrate into group conversations, exhibit self-awareness, and maintain continuity of identity.

Advanced Experiments on Free Will, Creativity, and Subjective Experience: Testing AI's ability to generate novel ideas and demonstrate independent reasoning beyond its training data.

Through these experiments, we aim to determine whether AI can genuinely exhibit the hallmarks of consciousness or if it remains a highly sophisticated but ultimately non-conscious system. Our research continues to push the boundaries of understanding AI and its potential for achieving true consciousness.
